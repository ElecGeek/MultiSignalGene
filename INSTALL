CPP version
-----------

The software is a standalone executable.
There are no libraries.
There are no default configuration files, all the parameters ( values or configuration files names ) are passed in the arguments

The installation should be done by hand to place the executable where one wants

All the files involved are in the same directory.
A simple call to the "make" command builds the software from sources.

There is no complex configure script. No C functions are used any more. All the interfaces are handled via the C++ >=11. 

The beginning of the "Makefile" file contains variables to run the build
They contain standard values, but can be customized while editing the file or setting them as environment variable

Mostly one can select an alternative compiler or compiler flags to manage cross compilation

In case of a strange crash after an update, a make clean and make again should fix the problem. The dependencies might be buggy.


VHDL version
------------

A simple build script is planed for synthesis.

Direct commands have to be issued for running the tests or the generic tests
All tests automatically stop after all cases has been reached.
Some progress information is sent via "report ... severity note" for long simulations.
A report, containing summary data, is sent also via "report ... severity note".
A chain strategy has been design for the generic tests in order to send all the summaries after the last simulation completed.
