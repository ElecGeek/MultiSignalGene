REQUIREMENTS TO BUILD

Basic tool chains to build C++17 or higher software

Run and dev libraries.
Optional Jackaudio run and dev packages if has been selected in the makefile (or as environment variable).


REQUIREMENTS TO RUN

An up and running machine.
Graphic environment is not required
Optional Jackaudio server running (jackd), if has been selected in the makefile (or as environment variable).
  If Jackaudio is not normally used on the target machine, to not make conflicts with other sound software,
  if the "physical" sound is not required, jack can be started on the dummy device driver.
  For that, type "jackd -d dummy -C 2 -P 2"


WHY CHOOSE OR NOT JACKAUDIO?

* To play live some sound, it is required
* To view the envelope or the sound, using the X42_scope (or other), it is required

* To check the syntax of the Jack connection data, it is NOT required
* To generate a sound file, intended to be played later, using third party software, it is NOT required
* To check the syntax of a parameter file, regardless to convert or not into another one, it is NOT required


OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Doxygen
    Doxygen is only required to build the documentation

Graphviz
    Graphviz is required to get smarter graphics while using Doxygen


CONFIGURATION
    There is no configure file as the software is written and relay on the standard C++ objects
      Then the configuration comes with the compiler
    The makefile understands the CXX, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS variables for cross compilation
	The makefile understands the SRCDIR, BUILDDIR and EXECDIR variables for non standard paths
	The CXX_Version should not be touched
    The makefile understands the DEFAULTWAVE variable. Values are SINE, PULSES or TRIANGLES
    The makefile understands the WITH_JACK variable. Values are YES or NO


TESTED
    It has been (yet) tested on 32 and 64 bits Intel based CPU.
	It has been tested with an old 13.3.0 gcc compiler.
	It might work with older compilers, but not that old than the 8.5.0 (problem with the optional template).
